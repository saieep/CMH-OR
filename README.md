# Project Title

 Write a program to implement the Chandy–Misra–Haas Algorithm for the OR model.
For submission, you have to adhere to the following instructions:

·      Put the source file(s), the executable file(s) and a README file in one folder.

·      Create a zipped folder containing the solution and submit the final zipped folder to the elearn portal.

·      The README file should contain the relevant information required for compiling and executing code(s) for evaluation as well as any platform related dependency (like what operating system is required for execution). 
       The README file should also contain the format of the input to be given to the program. It is mandatory to include the README file in your submission.

The assignment is based on the concepts and algorithm included in the syllabus. The syllabus for this lab component includes topics included in modules 1 to 6 (upto Deadlock Detection). 
The program is to be implemented in C/ C++/ Java/Python. Any other programming language other than C, C++, Java or Python will not be considered.This notice is also provided as an attached pdf.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Operating System : OS Independent
Online Compiler : https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
